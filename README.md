# Supplementary Material for my Master's Thesis

## Overview

This repository contains Unity packages, which include the applications I developed for my master's thesis, titled:

**Creating Presence for Social Cross-Reality Situations**

The audio files used in the master's thesis are also in the repository in the audio-files directory.

## Unity

To test and use the applications tokens for Photon Voice 2 and Photon Fusion 2 are needed. You can get them at the Photon Engine Website.

Each `.unitypackage` file can be imported into a Unity project to quickly add the contents.

The smartphone applications run on iOS, the VR apps on Meta Quest 2. There seems to be a problem with the DNS and the Photon frameworks on the Quest that needs to be fixed. It could be due to an update. However on a computer the apps work fine with the XR Device Simulator.

## Real-Time Tracking System

The code for the real-time tracking system can be found
